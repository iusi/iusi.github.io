					It may be my fault, but I can't.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every day I woke up wishing I were dead. Yes, I'm a coward who's never willing to take any responsibility, and 
					I'm a dope who can do nothing but endless complain. I desperately want to be loved, just like an infant.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm negative and useless.
				</p>
				<p>
					These are not <i>"bad thoughts"</i>   , rather, these are truths I have to face. I was kind and weak, 
					that's why I had always been bullied. I was young, that's why I shouldn't feel melancholy. 
					I want to drink and smoke every day, just like my dad does, for it helps alleviate my endless pain by 
					providing me with a moment of euphoria. 
					But I can't. Because I don't make money, and I don't have a fiancée.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless, present never bothered me as future did. 
				</p>
				<p>
					What am I going to do after graduating from college? To be a nobody and earn a wage so little that 
					barely do I make ends meet? Or to be a runaway living like a refugee and forgotten by the world?
				</p>
				<p>
					Not to mention my mental illness never stops troubling me.
				</p>
				<p>
					I covet love, which I don't and (firmly believed) I won't deserve and get. There used to be 
					<span title="Anny">someone</span> who's kind enough to care for me, yet how could I 
					possibly deserve such an awesome and caring girl like her?
				</p>
				<p>
					My life's been set. Alone, unloved, coward, mentally suffering...... Come on 
					I am an epitome of loser and bad guy!
				</p>
				<p>
					Just fuck it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					:-(
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether 'tis nobler? To struggle in vain and lie to myself? Or to escape from this 
					harsh world and into the unknown?
				</p>
				<p>
					I know I should not do this, but, I wish there'll be someone,
					 like Anny, who would care for me, encourage me and help me out of this dark abyss.
