					It was a beautiful accident that I met Elsa.<br>

				<p class="article">
					One day in the summer of 2017, I was listening to the beautiful rhythm of <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/av32030458/" class="linkunderline">Piano guys' Let It Go</a>, a notion came into my mind: maybe I should search 
					it on YouTube to watch the MV! But to my surprise, the first result came from Disney's cartoon Frozen.
				</p>
				<p class="article">
					"How can such a melodious song be related to a cartoon?", I thought, then unwillingly clicked it.
				</p>
				<p class="article">
					I was shocked the second video started playing: the music was mesmerizing, and the animation was excellent,
					 Elsa was beautiful. Soon I was mesmerized by her magic, her voice, and simply, her hairstyle.
					Never had I seen such a satisfying video before.
				</p>
				<p class="article">And the moment I desperately fell in love, or <i>coup de foudre</i>   , is when <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Rs411D7bJ" class="linkunderline">she let her hair down.</a></p>

				<p class="article">
					After watching Frozen that night, I was deeply touched and moved by its plots.
					 That <i>je ne sais quoi</i>   quality Elsa has, and her pretty visage stayed in my mind for 
					 a long period.
				</p>
				<p class="article">
					I can relate to her: we're unloved though we long for love, we conceal ourselves to avoid hurting
					 those who we care, and we want freedom. I was fascinated by her relatable and complex inner world.
				</p>

				<p class="article">
					The world is harsh and cruel, Elsa is my relief, an imaginary character who I can trust and 
					love without potentially hurting myself. 
				</p>
				<p class="article">
					Who can I trust in this world? No one, and there won't be anyone who would love me too, 
					so to devote my time and emotion on Elsa is the best choice, where, sure she won't love me back, 
					but won't hurt me as well.
				</p>
				<p class="article">
					It's coward of me to love Elsa, but that's also the reason for me to live, or my <i>raison d'Ãªtre.</i>
